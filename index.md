# Lock-free Self-balancing Binary Search Tree
## Team Members: Ziyuan Chen (ziyuanc), Ruogu Du (ruogud)

### Summary

For this project, we will implement a lock-free concurrent self-balancing binary search tree, whose performance will be compared against concurrent binary trees with locks. If there is time left, we will use the binary search tree to implement a lock-free C++ STL.

### Background

Self-balancing binary search trees are an important type of data structures used in the underlying implementation of many containers, libraries, and algorithms. Usually, they achieve self-balancing through a certain sequence of rotations when there is a change in the tree while maintaining all BST properties.

If a tree structure is shared among multiple threads, typically in a shared memory address space, the data structure needs to be protected from race conditions. All operations, including insertion, deletion, modification, read, and rotation, need to be atomic. Intuitively, such requirements can be satisfied with locking. However, locks create thread stalls which can hurdle the performance of a parallel program. In this project, we will work on implementing a lock-free version of this data structure.

There are three major variants of self-balancing BSTs that we will consider using. They are AVL trees, red-black trees, and splay trees. They all have their advantages and disadvantages. Because the AVL and the splay tree are relatively easy to implement, we will start from one of them. However, red-black trees are used more frequently in production-level libraries, so we will strive to implement a lock-free version of it as well.

Depending on our schedule, we might work on implementing container classes to achieve a lock-free version of C++ Standard Template Library(STL) using our lock-free self-balancing BSTs. For example, the map<> and set<> classes can benefit from our lock-free trees. Our project, if successful and combined with prior works on lock-free data structures, will result in a lock-free production-level C++ STL.

### Challenges

First of all, it is very difficult to come up with a lock-free algorithm, especially for insertions and rotations, where we need to keep correctness while avoiding race conditions. We will look for existing research papers that could provide us with some insight.

Secondly, due to the complexity of the data structure, we might need to relax the constraint on order. This should be acceptable as long as we avoid a thread trying to read a node that has already been deleted.

Lastly, we need to make sure that our lock-free implementation is sufficiently optimized to outperform the implementation using locks for it to be a meaningful project.

### Goals and Deliverables

Our primary goal is to implement a lock-free self-balancing BST that outperforms implementations with simple locking schemes. We believe that we can achieve this goal because we learned from the lecture that lock-free implementations should outperform simply locking if done correctly, and have already found some valuable research papers in this topic. Our extra goal is to use this BST to implement lock-free STL containers that use self-balancing BSTs, such as the map. If our work goes slower than expected, we would implement a lock-free binary search tree with relaxed capability to self-balance.

We will demonstrate our project using demo programs that we will write. We will run and time some parallel programs that use our lock-free BST, and show its performance compared to the same programs using a BST with locks. If we were to manage to finish lock-free STL, we would demonstrate the performance of our version versus the version with locking. We will run these benchmarks in front of the audience, while also putting diagrams and results on the poster.

Deliverables:

- A simple lock-free self-balancing BST: AVL or splay tree.
- A more complex lock-free BST: red-black tree.
- If we go ahead of the schedule, a lock-free concurrent STL data structure using our BST.


### Platform Choice

We will choose C++ as the programming language. This is because it provides more low-level flexibility such as memory management and pointer operations than other object-oriented languages. Also, it has the pthreads library which can be easily used to write parallel benchmarking programs.

Because this project is not computationally expensive nor relies on any specific hardware, we will mostly be using our own machines as the platform for development. For benchmarking, we might use the Xeon Phi Latedays server because it contains more cores than our own laptops, allowing us to benchmark our projectâ€™s performance for a large number of threads.
